This project will use a fiber optic star field located on the ceiling of the 3W suite lounge to localize a robotic Neato
We will capture multiple images of the 3W suite loungeâ€™s starry ceiling, image stitch them together with an OpenCV toolbox, then use feature matching on custom descriptors to determine which position and orientation a specific view of the ceiling was taken from.
